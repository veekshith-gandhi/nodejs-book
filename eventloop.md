## What is the Event Loop?

Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous tasks. Since Node.js is single-threaded, it cannot wait for one task to finish before starting another. Instead, it delegates tasks (like file reading, API calls) and processes them when they are ready.

## Task Types in Node.js

# Microtasks (High Priority)

- These run immediately after the current execution finishes and before the event loop continues to the next phase.
1. process.nextTick() (Highest priority in Node.js)
2. Promise.then() and Promise.catch()
3. queueMicrotask()

# Macrotasks (Lower Priority)
- These run in different event loop phases and include:

1. setTimeout()
2. setInterval()
3. setImmediate()
4. I/O operations (e.g., fs.readFile())
5. Timers and other callbacks


## Perfect Analogy for Microtasks vs. Macrotasks
# ðŸŽ¬ Think of a Restaurant
Imagine you're at a busy restaurant:

- Microtasks (Immediate Attention - Urgent VIP Customers)
These are customers who call the waiter directly for urgent orders (like extra ketchup).
Waiter stops for a second and serves them before moving to the next table.
- Macrotasks (Regular Orders - Scheduled Tasks)
These are regular food orders (setTimeout, setImmediate, file reading).
The waiter takes the order, sends it to the kitchen, and serves other tables while waiting.
- Event Loop (The Waiter)
The waiter (event loop) keeps moving between tables (tasks).
After serving VIP customers (microtasks), they go back to serving regular food orders (macrotasks).
