## why node js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was only used inside web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) to make web pages interactive. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on a server, making it possible to build backend applications like APIs, web servers, and real-time chat applications.
