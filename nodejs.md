## why node js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was only used inside web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) to make web pages interactive. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on a server, making it possible to build backend applications like APIs, web servers, and real-time chat applications.

## How does Node.js work?

Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used in Google Chrome), but it also includes additional features like:

- Non-blocking I/O - It can handle multiple requests at the same time.
- Single-threaded - It runs JavaScript code in a single thread but uses an event-driven architecture to handle multiple operations efficiently.
- libuv - A library that helps Node.js manage asynchronous tasks like file reading, network requests, and database queries.
